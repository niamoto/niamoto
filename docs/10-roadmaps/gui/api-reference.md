# GUI API Reference (Coming Soon)

A detailed reference for the FastAPI endpoints exposed by the GUI backend will be published here.

While documentation is being prepared, explore:
- The autogenerated OpenAPI schema available at `/docs` when the GUI backend is running.
- The router modules in `src/niamoto/gui/api/routers/` for current endpoint definitions.
- The GUI roadmap in this directory to see planned expansions.
