# GUI Architecture Notes (Coming Soon)

This document will deep-dive into the planned architecture for the Niamoto GUI, including component boundaries, state management, and API interactions.

Until then, consult:
- [GUI Architecture Roadmap](../architecture.md) for the big-picture plan.
- [FastAPI Dual Purpose Architecture](../fastapi-dual-purpose-architecture.md) for current backend goals.
- Source files under `src/niamoto/gui/` for implementation details.
