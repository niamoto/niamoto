# Contributing to the GUI (Coming Soon)

Guidelines for contributing to the GUI roadmap will cover coding standards, review expectations, and design resources.

In the meantime:
- Follow the general project [Development Setup](../../../11-development/setup.md).
- Review open items in the GUI roadmap files within this directory.
- Coordinate through GitHub issues or discussions when proposing large UI changes.
