# First Pipeline (Coming Soon)

We’re actively working on a hands-on walkthrough that shows how to assemble your first Niamoto data pipeline from start to finish.

In the meantime:
- Follow the steps in [Installation](installation.md) and [Quick Start](quickstart.md) to create your base project.
- Explore the [Data Pipeline](../02-data-pipeline/README.md) section for detailed import, transform, and export guidance.
- Check the [Tutorials](../07-tutorials/README.md) for real-world configurations you can adapt to your use case.
