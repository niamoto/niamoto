# ML Training Example (Coming Soon)

This guide will demonstrate how to prepare datasets, configure detection plugins, and evaluate model performance using Niamoto’s ML tooling.

While we finalize the tutorial, you can:
- Review the [Training Guide](../03-ml-detection/training-guide.md) for current best practices.
- Experiment with the [Auto-Configuration roadmap](../03-ml-detection/auto-config-roadmap.md) to understand upcoming features.
- Explore the sample scripts in `examples/` to bootstrap your experiments.

Contributions welcome—feel free to suggest workflows or share datasets that should be covered.
