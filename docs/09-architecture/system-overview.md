# Architecture System Overview (Coming Soon)

Until the full overview is published, refer to:
- [Plugin System](plugin-system.md) for details on extensibility.
- [Pipeline Unified](pipeline-unified.md) to understand the processing flow.
- [Corrections Roadmap](corrections-roadmap.md) for ongoing architectural improvements.
