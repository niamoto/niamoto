# Testing Guidelines (Coming Soon)

This document will consolidate test strategies, coverage expectations, and tooling tips for Niamoto contributors.

While we prepare the full guide:
- Run the default suite with `uv run pytest`.
- See `tests/` for examples of unit, integration, and CLI tests.
- Refer to `pyproject.toml` for linting and type-checking commands that should accompany new code.
