# Contributing Guide (Coming Soon)

We are finalizing contributor onboarding materials that cover workflow expectations, code style reminders, and review checklists.

Until then:
- Follow the steps in [Setup](setup.md) to prepare your environment.
- Review open issues and roadmaps in `docs/10-roadmaps/` to align with ongoing priorities.
- Use `./scripts/smart_commit.sh` for conventional commits once your changes pass tests and linters.

If you have suggestions for what should appear here, please share them in the repository discussions or via a pull request.
